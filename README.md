This is a collection of latex files for generating slides for Fundamentals
of XAFS presentations.This collection has evolved over many years, and I
have given many talks using variations of these slides.  Some of these
files data back to at 2007 or earlier, though most have been updated much
more recently.  The files contain much of the material and figures that
went into *Fundamentals of XAFS*,  M. Newville, Reviews in  Mineralogy &
Geochemistry **78** (2014).   https://doi.org/10.2138/rmg.2014.78.2


The files here all use Latex and Beamer to generate PDF documents which are
then used for the presentations.

Many of the figures used are generated using Larch or similar software, and
scripts to generate the figures are included, though somewhat scattered.
Some very older figures were generated with gnuplot, and scripts are
included for those as well.
