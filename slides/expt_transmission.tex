  For concentrated samples, XAFS is best measured in transmission.
  We need enough transmission through the sample to get x-rays through the
  sample.

  With,  \[{ \mu(E)t  = - \ln(I/I_0) }\]
  
  We make the sample thickness ${t}$ so that ${ \mu(E)t \approx 1  < 3 }$.

  \begin{itemize}
  \pause \item  Samples typically need to $10{\mu}m$ or less!  
  \pause \item  They must be uniform, and free of pinholes.  
  \pause \item  grain size cannot be much bigger that an absorption length.
  \end{itemize}
