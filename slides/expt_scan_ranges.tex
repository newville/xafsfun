\begin{slide}{X-ray Absorption Measurements: The Experiment}

An XAFS measurement needs monochromatic x-ray that can be tuned in energy
across the absorption edge.  Typical scans are from ${\sim 200\rm\,eV}$
below to ${\sim 800\rm\, eV}$ an absorption edge, like this:

    \begin{tabular}{|lccc|}
      \hline
      Region & Starting Energy (eV)& Ending Energy (eV)& Step Size (eV)\\
      \hline
      Pre-edge     & -200 &   -20    &    5.0 \\
      XANES        & -20  &   +30    &    0.25 -- 0.50 \\
      EXAFS        & +30  &  $\bsim$ 800 &  0.05   ${\rm\,\AA^{-1}}$\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}

  (all values relative to a nominal x-ray absorption edge energy.)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the EXAFS region, it's common to step in {\slshape{k}}
    rather than energy.
  \item Typical count times are 1 to 15 seconds per point, so that
    EXAFS measurements take 10 minutes to several hours.
    
  \item Very fast measurements (1 second for the whole spectra) can
    be made at specialized beamlines.
   
  \end{itemize}
