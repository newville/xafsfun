    The Multiple Scattering (propagate,scatter,propagate,\ldots) approach 
    works well for EXAFS because the sum converges rapidly since:

    \begin{center} terms with 5 or more scatterings don't contribute
      strongly to EXAFS \end{center}


    This is due the combination of 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item finite size of $\lambda$
      \item $1/kR^2$
      \item disorder term:  $e^{-2k^2\sigma^2}$
    \end{itemize}
      
    \vmm   
    \hrule
    \vmm
    
    For XANES, the series does not converge rapidly (as $\lambda >
    10\rm\,\AA$, and effect of thermal disorder is small), but a
    {\RedEmph{Full Multiple Scattering}} approach can be used:
   
    \[ G = G^0 ( 1 - t G^0)^{-1} \]
    
    This is more computationally intensive (as a large scattering matrix
    must be inverted), but no longer prohibitive.
