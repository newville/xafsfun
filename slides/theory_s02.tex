\begin{slide}{$S_0^2$:  Amplitude Reduction Term (intrinsic losses)}

  Another important {\Red{Amplitude Reduction Term}} is due to the relaxation
  of the {\BlueEmph{other electrons in the absorbing atom}} to the hole in the
  core level:

   \vmm
   \[
   S_0^2 =  {  |{\langle \Phi^{N-1}_f |\Phi^{N-1}_0 \rangle}|^2}
   \]

   \vmm

   ${| \Phi^{N-1}_0 \rangle }$ = $(N-1)$ electrons in unexcited atom.

   ${\langle \Phi^{N-1}_f|}$   = $(N-1)$ electrons, relaxed by core-hole.

   ${S_0^2}$ is usually taken as a constant:

  \begin{postitbox}{25mm}   $ 0.7 < S_0^2 < 1.0 $ \end{postitbox}

  and is used as a Fitting Parameter that multiplies {$\chi$}:

  \begin{postitbox}{71mm} \justify{\vspace{-4mm} This -- along with
      normalization of spectra -- makes EXAFS amplitudes (and therefore
      {\Blue{$N$}}) less precise than EXAFS phases (and therefore
      {\Blue{$R$}}).}
