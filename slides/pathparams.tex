\begin{slide}{Path Parameters: what can we vary in a fit?}

\begin{cenpage}{108mm}
  The EXAFS Equation has at least 4 adjustable parametes {\RedEmph{Per
      Path}}:
  $E_0$, $NS_0^2$, $R$, and $\sigma^2$.  \hspace{5mm}     But $N_{\rm idp}$  is low:

  \[ N_{\rm idp} = 8 \> \> \>
  {\rm for} \> \Delta R = 1 \, {\rm \AA} \>\> {\rm and} \>\> \Delta k = 12.5\,
  {\rm \AA^{-1} } \]

  \vmm\onslide+<2->

  For simple crystalline structures with well-isolated, single-scattering
  path (like FeO), it's OK to fit $N$, $R$, $\sigma^2$, and $E_0$ for every
  path.

  \vmm

  For more complicated problems, we need a way to limit the number of
  parameters varied.

  \vmm

  We might {\emph{want}} to impose relationships between parameters to get
  more meaningful results\ldots
