        The Fe-Fe EXAFS extends to higher-$\mathbf{k}$ than the Fe-O EXAFS.
        
        \vmm Even in this simple system, there is some
        {\RedEmph{overlap}} of shells in $\mathbf{R}$-space.
        
        \vmm The agreement in $\mathbf{\rm Re[\bchi(R)]}$ look especially
        good -- this is how the fits are done.

        \vmm
        
        Of course, the modeling can get more complicated than this!
