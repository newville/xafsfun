    The energies of the {\slshape{K}} shell absorption edges for the
    elements go as  $E_K \sim Z^2$.


    {\wgraph{85mm}{general/kl_edges}}


    Elements with $Z > 18$ have {\slshape{K}}-, or {\slshape{L}}-edge
    between 2 and 35 keV, which can be accessed at many synchrotron
    sources.

    \vmm
    Lower $Z$ elements (softer x-rays) can be measured as well, but may
    require working in vacuum.
