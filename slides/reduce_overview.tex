  Step for reducing measured data to ${\mu(E)}$ and then
  to ${\chi(k)}$:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item convert measured intensities to ${\mu(E)}$
  \item subtract a smooth pre-edge function, to get rid of any instrumental
    background, and absorption from other edges. 
  \item normalize ${\mu(E)}$ to go from 0 to 1, so that it represents the
    absorption of 1 x-ray.
  \item remove a smooth post-edge background function to approximate
    ${\mu_0(E)}$ to isolate the XAFS ${\chi}$.
  \item identify the threshold energy ${E_0}$, and convert from
    ${E}$ to ${k}$ space: ${ k=
      \sqrt{{{2m(E-E_0)}\over{\hbar^2}}} }$
  \item weight the XAFS ${\chi(k)}$ and Fourier transform from
    ${k}$ to ${R}$ space.
  \item  isolate the ${\chi(k)}$ for an individual
  ``shell''  by Fourier filtering.
  \end{enumerate}

  After we get this far, we'll model ${f(k)}$ and
  ${\delta(k)}$ and analyze ${\chi(k)}$ to get distance
  ${R}$, coordination number ${N}$.
