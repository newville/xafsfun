  EXAFS Analysis is challenging:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Lots of Paths.

  \item \feffc{f(k)}, \feffc{\delta(k)} are not trivial.

  \item There's not much information in a real measurement:
    $ N_{\rm idp} \approx \frac{2\Delta k\Delta R}{\pi} $

  \end{enumerate}

  We need to:

   \begin{enumerate}
   \item {\Blue{reduce}} the number of Paths to consider (Fourier analysis).
   \item {\Blue{re-use}}  {\scshape{feff}} calculations for  \feffc{f(k)} and \feffc{\delta(k)}.
   \item {\Blue{recycle}} parameters to cut down the number of independent
     variables in the fit, while keeping a meaningful analysis.
   \end{enumerate}
